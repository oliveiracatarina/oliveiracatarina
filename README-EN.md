Junior Developer with intermediate experience in Java and intermediate knowledge in Python. I have worked with Spring Boot, performing unit tests with JUnit and Mockito, and have basic knowledge of Postman for API testing. I have basic experience with JDBC and JPA, as well as familiarity with Git and knowledge in Azure. I studied JavaScript during my undergraduate studies and am able to develop with the language according to project demands.

I am a professional who learns quickly, autonomously, and I find it easy to seek knowledge on my own. I seek to ask questions only when necessary, optimizing learning and productivity. Furthermore, I am adaptable, enjoy challenges, and am always willing to deepen my knowledge to better contribute to the team and projects.

Currently, I am in a career transition, migrating from back-end development to the area of Generative AI. I have intermediate knowledge in Java, Python and basic Quality Assurance skills. I have experience in unit testing, process documentation, requirements gathering, and data modeling, with a growing focus on improving my data-related knowledge. I am skilled in identifying and solving quality issues, as well as creating computerized solutions aligned with organizational needs and business expectations. I am familiar with Microsoft Azure, including Azure Data Factory, Dataflow, and Databricks, for building and managing data pipelines and analysis in cloud environments. I am committed to continuous improvement and software quality throughout the development cycle.
